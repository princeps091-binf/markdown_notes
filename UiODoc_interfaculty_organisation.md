Hi (Name),

It's me once again from UiODoc. We are now starting to put together the interfaculty meeting that we mentioned on our last zoom call.
So in order to get this going we've set up a Doodle to figure out the optimal time and date for this meeting for all the representatives across faculties.
I was wondering if you could fill the Doodle throughout the week so we can save the date as soon as possible for everyone.
If the link doesn't work or you need anything at all, please let me know!

Hi (Name),

It's me once again from UiODoc. After having consulted with other temporary staff Faculty representatives, it appeared that a conversation across faculties to better understand the situation of PhDs and post-docs across the university would be very useful. We therefore are extending the invitation to you as well, as your perspective would greatly help in this effort!

Dear all,

Due to scheduling incompatibilities we have had to change the time slot for the inter-faculty meeting. I hope that all of you who have had the chance to answer before can also make it this time. 

This new time slot will hopefully work for more people so we can have a more productive discussion and have more view points at the meeting. In that spirit if you feel that other individuals could contribute to this discussion feel free to extend this invitation to them too or contact us.

For the people that have already put in dates, their respective lines will be covered in question marks, but you can still edit them and fill in your preffered date/time. 

Hopefully this time we can set a date that works for the majority of people and we apoligise for any inconvenience caused by this change.

All the best from UiO Doc,
Vipin & Jesus 

Dear Rachel,

I hope you are doing well.

Dear all,

Following the outcome of the updated doodle poll we shared with all of you, couple dates emerged as good candidates that would work for most participants. We therefore would like to inform you that the inter-faculty meeting will be taking place on June 2nd between 16:00 and 18:00.

More details about the format, content and on whether it'll be a "physical" or an online meeting will follow shortly.

Please don't hesitate to reach back to us if you have any query.

Thanking all of you for your cooperation and availability,
Best regards,

Dear all,

We have decided to hold the upcoming interfaculty meeting online over zoom. Please find below the necessary details to access the meeting:

Date: June 2nd 2021
Time: 16:00-18:00

Zoom meeting URL:
https://uio.zoom.us/j/69196454959?pwd=a0hGejJKWE9NSXdpL0NYN2hqbGVuQT09

Meeting ID: 691 9645 4959
Passcode: 665138

We also would like to take this opportunity to outline the content, format and objective of this meeting.

Following our various discussions with each faculty representative, it emerged that many issues were shared across faculties and that the agency of representatives in their respective faculty would be further strengthened if they could leverage the accumulated experience university-wide.

In this spirit, this meeting is firstly an opportunity for faculty representatives to get to know each other and collectively reflect on ways to further promote the interest of PhDs and Post-Docs.

We have organised this meeting around 4 themes:

- Relation to administration
- Relation to temporary staff (PhDs and Post-Docs)
- COVID situation
- How to stay in touch and collaborate across faculties

We hope to allocate around 20-30 min for each theme, and therefore it would be great if participants could prepare some thoughts, talking points, suggestions, etc. for each theme, that reflect the situation of their respective faculty.

Members of UiODoc will act as moderators to ensure that the meeting stays on track regarding time-keeping and scope.

Please let us know if you have any questions and we look forward to seeing you.
Best regards,

Vipin.

                        - not so effective
                    - Reconcile social arena with representative arena
                        - resonate at our meetings such as PPBC -> raise awareness and re-direct towards Faculty rep's

                - UiODoc -> repository of links for rookies (MatNat)

                - Report on the state from temporary staff -> consultation + meeting

Dear Ms. Ghazaleh Amini,

My name is Vipin Kumar, I am contacting you as the Representative Officer of UiODoc, which is an organization that works to support and improve the academic, educational and social experiences of PhD candidates and postdocs at the University of Oslo (https://foreninger.uio.no/uiodoc/). 
We aim to represent their interests within UiO and provide academic/social networking opportunities across all faculties by organizing both professional and social events.

We have been invited to contribute to UiO's response to the Government's long-term plan for Norwegian research and education. In this effort we have identified the investment in infrastructure to support international staff to be an under-represented issue.
To this end I am contacting you as I am hoping that your organisation might have some essential factual elements demonstrating the need for more investment in the infrastructures supporting international staff. 
In particular we would be interested in any statistics describing the current situation of UiO accomodations accessible to international staff, hiring of international staff, turnover of international staff, their proportion relative to the total UiO staff, or any other statistical of factual elements you might consider important to include in our response. 

Unfortunately the deadline for our response to UiO is due by this Wednesday 18th, which I understand is very short notice. Nevertheless if you need more time to collect these elements we would be very happy to include them in our contribution to the Stipendiatorganisasjonene i Norge (SiN) response to the Government's long-term plan, as the deadline for their response in due by early September.

Thanking you in advance,
Best regards,
Vipin Kumar, UiODoc representative Officer

Hi ,

It's me once again from UiODoc. After the positive response from the inter-faculty conversation between temporary staff representatives held earlier this summer, we wanted to pursue our effort towards a greater integration of faculty representatives with UiODoc. 

So in order to get this momentum going we are kindly inviting you to attend the UiODoc Annual General Assembly taking place tomorrow (September 14 2021) between 5:00 PM–7:00 PM at Sophus Bugges hus, auditorium 1 (https://goo.gl/maps/WX1LhqteRX53jrpc8). 

There will also be a Zoom option for people prefering to attend online using the following credentials:

# Revised Representative Officers

## Your role 

Act as the interface between UiODoc and the multitude of UiO representatives that constitute the contact points between PhDs/Post-Docs and UiO administration. Because of UiODoc's unique position at the intersection of many institutional levels within UiO and beyond, we have the opportunity to create a space where the shared and specific struggles of PhDs and Post-docs across UiO can be discussed.

The Representative's Officer, along with any other interested board members, is responsible for maintaining and animating this space with the aim of strengthening the collective and coordinated defense of the interest of PhDs and Post-docs. 
Achieving this requires a series of necessary ressources:
- Up to date repository of contact details for temporary staff representatives at various institutional levels but at least for UiO board and the Faculty boards.
    - minimal How-To
        - For the considered institution (UiO,Faculty,Department,Institute)
            - go to corresponding website
                - favour the norwegian version as it tends to be more up to date
            - go to "Om fakultet/UiO/Dept./etc" -> "Organisasjon" -> "*styret"
                - Depending on the institution you will find a table or a list with board members details
                - Look for "Midlertidig vitenskapelig ansatte"
- Building a working relation with temp. staff representatives
    - 1-on-1 meeting
        - Create an effective dialogue/working relation between UiODoc and as many faculty representatives as possible. Possible strategies include:
            - Regular updates about Dept./Faculty/UiO board meeting agenda (in person/online)
                - information flow about emerging issues raised by constituents
            - Sharing knowledge-base accumulated from past interactions/collaborations with former/current temp. staff reps to secure
                - ability to work effectively as representative even for rookies (on-boarding)
                - continuity of actions undertaken by former generations of representatives

- Elaborating strategies to better coordinate the activities of temporary staff representatives and UiODoc
    - The exact form of these actions will need to match the current state of temporary staff representatives' engagement with the priority being:
        1. Effective working relation between temp. staff representatives
            - regular conversation about emerging issues across faculties
                - Dinner
                - Round-table
            - Temporary staff rep's mailing list
        2. Effective organisation for coordinated actions UiO-wide
            - framework to elaborate priorities and strategies to improve the condition of PhDs/Post-Docs
                - Working groups
                - Event/Meeting/Hearing with relevant stakeholders


To contact:

- UiO temp. staff rep
- Faculty temp. staff rep (+ deputies ?)
- Signe and Karin -> PhD rep at Social Sciences ~ similar synergy as in Law?
- Union rep -> Forskeforbundet + NTU + Akademirne

Faculty rep:

Dear Hilde Marie,

I am contacting you on behalf of UiODoc, which is an organization that works to support and improve the academic, educational and social experiences of PhD candidates and postdocs at the University of Oslo. We aim to represent their interests within UiO and provide academic/social networking opportunities across all faculties by organizing both professional and social events.

Last year we initiated a process aiming to better involve your work as faculty representative with our activity as an university-wide organisation. This resulted in a series of discussions including an inter-faculty round-table with representatives from different faculties. We thought these exchanges were very constructive and we ambition to pursue this effort.

In this spirit, we are hoping to discuss with you about your current activities and concerns as a representative. Would you be available for a quick meeting (in person or online) in the coming weeks?

Looking forward to hearing back from you,
Best regards,

Vipin Kumar,
UiODoc Representative Officer

PhD council social sciences

Dear Signe and Karin,

I am contacting you on behalf of UiODoc, which is an organization that works to support and improve the academic, educational and social experiences of PhD candidates and postdocs at the University of Oslo. We aim to represent their interests within UiO and provide academic/social networking opportunities across all faculties by organizing both professional and social events.

Earlier this year you reached out to us and due to various circumstances we weren't able to concretely follow-up until now. We would be very interested in exploring with you ways UiODoc could collaborate and coordinate better with your activities and support your role as PhD representatives at the Faculty of Social Sciences.

In this spirit, we are hoping to discuss with you about your current activities and concerns as representatives. Would you be available for a quick meeting (in person or online) in the coming weeks?

Looking forward to hearing back from you,
Best regards,

Vipin Kumar,
UiODoc Representative Officer



Dear Trine,

Thank for your clear answer, we understand the procedure and you can transfer the deposit money to same account.

We are planning to move out on November 29th and will clean the apartment right after. So we would be very grateful if we could get the paint before that day. 

Given this timeline if we could have the room inspection on the evening of November 30th or any time on December 1st that would be great. Please let us know what is most convenient for you.

On a different note, we managed to sell most of the furniture and will be leaving the oven and the kitchen drawers.

Let us know what works best for you and thanking you again for your helpfulness,
Best regards,
Azusa and Vipin.



Dear Lars,

I hope you are doing well. 

As we were moving in we noticed couple issues that seem to have happened before our arrival. First we noticed some marks of the wall and to make things as clear as possible we took pictures of these marks (attached to this email). We would be happy to paint over them with the same colour if that is possible. We also noticed that the door handle for the toilet isn't tightly fixed. This means that it comes out when we pull it. Would it be possible to get tools and screw to tighten it ? 

Best regards,

Azusa and Vipin.
