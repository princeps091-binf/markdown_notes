- Name + Position
- in this talk I will be introducing a multi-Omics computational method aiming to detect trx-hubs (present in more detail later) by integrating HiC with transcriptomics data

## 2 ToC
- Outline=
    - Bit of background to what I mean by "transcripional hubs"
    - Intro the main components of this computational method
    - Main results revolving around the examination of what makes being inside a hub so special

## 3-4 What are trx-hubs

- Starting assumption of this project= Notion that trx in the genome is organised as a collection of aggregates in the nucleus characterised by the co-localisation of regulatory factors and genomic regions to adequately coordinate the necessary transcription of the genome enabling the realisation of the cell's function
    - this contrasts with a perception of the nucleus as homogeneous soup with various factors freely diffusing and randomly encountering their targets
- What we expect characterises such transcriptional hubs is the compounded enrichment of both chromatin interactions + transcriptional events
    - Thus main objective = detecting instances of such compounded enrichment genome-wide

## 5-6 BootTHiC

- Algo = reflection of this goal to detect compounded enrichment of chromatin interaction AND trx events.
    - 1st interaction enrichment THEN trx enrichment
    - Chromatin interactions = HiC -> HTseq probing spatial affinity of pairs of regions genome-wide
        - Such enrichment expected to produce chromatin clusters characterised by displaying preferential self interaction
        - We also expect chromosome architecture to span a variety of scales which is why we leverage multiple resolution of HiC data to best describe those various scales + explicitly constrain our clusters to be nested within one another so that we have a coherent description of chromatin architecture across scales
        - These constraints form the essence of BHiCect 2.0 which a hierarchical clustering method we developed
            - main output = clustering tree that traces how the chromosome can be decomposed into nested preferentially self-interacting clusters starting from the whole chromosome to individual loops between pairs of bins.
    - Trx-enrichment= Among these clusters enrichment in HiC interactions (in a genome we produce around 0.5M such clusters) which one actually display a trx-enrichment characterising trx-hubs?
        - Tech = CAGE-seq ~ RNAseq with very precise detection of trx-events (sharp-peaks) + capacity to distinguish promoter and enhancers, which will prove relevant in our results
        - Trx-activity in cluster = number of CAGE-peaks contained
            - Estimate how exceptional this observed count?
                - compare with relevant "random" counts for that cluster
                    - this method = bootstrapping
                    - careful elaboration of "random" to account for confounding factors that might bias CAGE-peak counts.
        - Comparing observed vs random counts produces an empirical p-value which we further correct for multiple testing using DAGGER which accounts for the nested dependence of the found clusters.
        - Main output = collection of candidate trx-hubs (illustrated on the right)
            - Custom visualisations to reflect the specificities of the clusters we produce

## 7-8
- V. briefly give some intuition about what these hubs represent
- We tried our method on 3 cell-lines: GM12878 (immune), HMEC (mammary epithelia) and H1 (stem cell)
    - have BOTH HiC + CAGE (condition or limitation of our method)
- Across cell-lines find from 6K-8K hubs genome-wide 
    - wide variety of size (10's kb to multiple Mb's)
    - variety of interaction patterns
        - diagonal blocks ~ TADs (checked that we actually recover them)
        - checkerboard
        - streaks        
    - extensive overlap but still quite different neighbourhoods formed
    - always observe majority (50%-60%) of CAGE peaks within hubs
- Any functionaly relevance to these structures beyond the concentration of most of the trx-events?

## 9-10 
- Examining how various functional features distinguish being in vs out of hubs
    - Here CAGE's capacity to distinguish between promoter and enhancer becomes handy
        - Examine how promoter/enhancer content in vs out of hubs differ
        - Promoter specificity
        - Enhancer activity

## 11
- Promoter specificity through gene set enrichment
    - evaluate how genes associated with promoters found inside hubs seem to highlight any particular fn
        - Gene set enrichment analysis using Gene ontology
            - function ~ gene sets curated by GO-consortium (expt support for association with various aspects of cell physiology)
            - Define:
                - BG = All genes associated with active CAGE-peaks (as documented by FANTOM 5)
                - FG = All genes associated with active CAGE-peak found within hubs
                - test = hypergeom with FDR correction
## 12
- Gradient of specificity across cell-lines
    - GM12878 (immune) > HMEC (cell matrix, wounding, epithelia, etc) > H1 (unclear)
- Supported notion of hub-gene specificity by depletion of housekeeping genes inside compared to geneome-wide expectation

## 13
- Enhancer activity
    - Proxy for activity = 
        - ChIP for H3K27ac + RNAP2
        - CAGE-read count level directly
    - For each enhancer assign maximum lvl observed for considered cell-line
    - Compare enhancer in vs out of hubs
        - non-parametric test to estimate significance of this difference
## 14
- Pattern quite straightforward
    - systematically higher activity for enhancers inside compared to outside hubs
        - interestingly such property not observed for promoter.

## 15
- Shifting gears bit by considering relation to cancer
    - Considering cancer involves extensive gene dysregulation
        - Hubs could be particularly impacted since they concentrate so much of trx signal
## 16
- Strategy = Compare change in expression between healthy and cancer samples and examine if this change differs depending on whether you are in vs out of hubs?
    - Have trx data for healthy and cancer breast epithelium
        - HMEC vs MCF7/MDA
    - Have already found trx hubs in healthy breast epithelium
    - Perform DGE analysis (DESeq2) with these samples and compare the differential expression pattern inside vs outside hubs

## 17
- Genes inside hubs seem to be prefferentially down regulated compared to genes outside hubs
    - LFC negative bump
    - Clear enrichment in most significantly down-regulated genes within hubs

## 18
- BootTHiC enables the detection of chromatin clusters compounding both HiC and trx enrichment (could be extended to any narrow epigenetic feature)
    - Illustrated the relevance of these hubs
        - contain more specialised genes
        - contain more active enhancer
        - get preferentially shutdown in cancer

## Abstract
The genome is a complex and dynamic object coordinating a multitude of processes enabling the appropriate activation of cell function from DNA information. Among this collection of processes, transcription plays a fundamental role as the necessary transition from the seemingly static and “universal” DNA information shared across a whole organism to the dynamic and particular transcription determining tissue function. 
The regulatory mechanisms enabling this transcriptional agility relies on a precise coordination of both genome structure and function. In this presentation I will cover how we integrated multiple omics data to chart this coordination. This effort highlighted transcriptional hubs as structures that dynamically concentrate relevant biological features across cell-lines. 
The detected hubs are characterised by hyper-active regulatory regions tightly coupled to cell-line specialised genes. We further show that genes found within hubs tend to be preferentially down-regulated upon shifting to a cancer state.
