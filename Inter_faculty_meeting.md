# Inter-faculty meeting of Temporary staff representatives
The main objective of this meeting was to bring together as many temporary staff faculty representatives as possible to collectively examine how to best leverage the capabilities this institutional position offers, with the explicit goal to improve the condition of PhDs and postdocs. In particular we discussed how to best elaborate effective strategies for representatives to adopt in their activity. What emerged is the necessity to ensure as much continuity over time and coherence across faculties, so that the propositions pushed in every faculty could benefit from the collective work of representatives university-wide and better reflect the reality of PhDs and postdocs.

Among the priorities highglighted by this discussion were the necessity to overcome the structural isolation experienced by faculty representatives and the importance to identify the distinct vulnerabilities of PhDs/postdocs the COVID crisis has revealed.

## Addressing the structural isolation of representatives
The isolation of representatives is two-fold, reflecting their intermediary position between the body of PhDs and postdocs employed at the faculty and the administration managing the faculty. Therefore there are two sides to a representative's position that require dedicated approaches to ensure the effective promotion of PhDs and postdocs interests within the Faculty's decision-making bodies.

### Relation to constituants

- Regarding the relation towards constituant, it became clear that there is a need for an effective interface relfecting the diversity of PhDs and postdocs. This my be achieved through a variety of events and channels, but with varying levels of success or applicability depending on the faculty.
    - "local" organisations (Dept., PhD forums, etc)
        - Events
            - events + yearly meetings
            - Attending PhD + PostDoc programmes -> Medicine faculty experience
                - not so effective
            - Reconcile social arena with representative arena
                - resonate at our meetings such as PPBC -> raise awareness and re-direct towards Faculty rep's
        - Representatives/comitees
            - Law -> PhD council great gateway -> not always available such as in Education
    - Online 
        - MatNat make small website on nettskema
            - nobody used it
        - website + facebook group 
        - welcome email for newly employed 
        
    - Survey/Questionaire/itw -> Law + MatNat + Edu.
    
    - Reaching through supervisors to raise -> target group for UiODoc to engage to increase our reach
        - Further reasons to strengthen relation with permanent staff representative
### Relation to administration
- Need for an Effective interface focusing on key gatekeepers and possible allies within the administration:
    - admin more welcoming now (according to MedFac)
        - not pro-active regarding understanding of the role of representative
        - tip: ally with permanent staff + other faculty staff (newsletter) + Faculty director
    - Promote regular systematic meetings with key stakeholders (MedFac)
        - below = 
            - PhD programme commitee + forum
            - Department board and representatives
        - above = 
            - Board secretary + Director
            - UiO temp. staff rep

## On the specific issues highlighted by COVID
- Law: gap between permanent and temporary staff
    - Find the space for expressing these issues is very challenging
- V. different situation across departments
    - hard to quantify, systematically describe/capture the situation
- General extension -> resistance from Deans despite Rektor support
    - what to do with the extra money + 
    - discouraged by supervisors to apply for extensions
- Holiday policy
    - supervisor-specific circumstance
    - growing need to address the specific needs of Int'l staff regarding remote working, holidays given exclusive and additional challenges when trying to spend time with 
    - Knowledge of the system to bypass supervisor decision making should be made more accessible

## Role of UiODoc
- Clarify how to get the information
    - UiODoc -> repository of links for rookies (MatNat)
- UiODoc role - Barking this issue of rep-engagement/agency at the various meetings with the stakeholders we engage with
    - Pick-up buzz-word at the different faculties
    - Report on the state from temporary staff -> consultation + meeting
- Emails most comprehensive tool
    - Drive to act as repository
    - Slack not necessarily accessible to everyone
    - Mailing list
        - include PhD council
- Actual meetings once a year/semester pass-over event -> Fall
    - old plus new representatives
- Reach out to Program comitees
    - UiO board staff rep -> election ongoing 
        - opportunity
