# THE SEXUAL DIVISION OF LABOUR IN THE ORIGINS OF MALE DOMINATION : A MARXIST PERSPECTIVE
## Traditional Marxist positions
At beginning of archeology/anthropology (2nd half of 19th century) a popular theory suggested that male domination followed an era of woman domination (supported by elements from ancient Greece and Iroquois societies). This system was believed to have guaranteed women a position of some prestige until the Age of Metals, when private property, material inequality and male domination developed all at the same time.
## The observations
Since this period a much broader body of evidence has been accumulated and it is important to examine how this early theory stand this trial. Firstly, gender relations do not conform to a single general law and tend to fall within a spectrum between exacerbated male domination and a relative gender balance. “Matriarchy” in the strict sense (where women lead) has never been observed in any community. This is true also for hunter-gatherer societies.
### “Neolithic” societies
There is clear evidence that male domination is set in law and that physical and symbolic violence imposed on women is institutionalised in these early societies.
### Nomadic hunter-gatherers
The situation is similarly unfavourable for women in nomadic societies.
## An initial assessment
- male domination is not restricted to a specific stage of technical and economic development
- on all continents and at all stages of social development the sexual division of labour and the existence of specific social is always observed.
This sexual division of labour could hold the key to determining gender inequality.
### The sexual division of labour
The sexual division of labour is the oldest form of the social division of labour (since hunter-gatherer). This division varies greatly among societies but we constantly observe a male monopoly on the military industrial complex (hunting,lethal weapon,politico-military functions). We cannot say for sure when this division emerged.
It is doubtful that it was established with the conscious purpose of male domination over women. Most likely it is the easiest form of division that could account for the relatively more vulnerable status imposed by pregnancy and motherhood, while allowing decent survival and ressource usage. 
More psychological motivations, like men trying to appropriate the reproductive power of women, are impossible to prove and doesn't explain why women would accept it. 
### Why control women?
- The economic dimension: Men have dominated women in order to appropriate their work (No clear evidence for this).
- The control of reproduction: In the form of forced reproduction or birth control (No clear evidence for this).

In all societies there is a focus on controlling women sexuality. This control, enforced by arms if necessary, is not to ensure exclusive sexual access to women, but to ensure exclusive right to dispose of them at men's will.
### Female counter-powers and pseudo-matriarchies
However, men have not always attained this situation of hegemony. In the famous examples of matriarchies (Iroquois,Minangkabau,Ngada and Na), a definite pattern emerges. The relatively favourable situation of women is associated with the matrilocal residence rule. This rule supposes a significant participation of women in production and distribution. 
## Subsequent developments
Male domination is rooted far in the past, long before the appearance of social classes and the State, even before the development of wealth and inequality. it is the product of establishing an almost complete incompatibility between the social roles assigned to women and another set of functions comprising hunting, weapons and warfare. This initial allocation conferred on men a strategically important position of the political leadership of the society. Later development like storage or intensive agriculture further disenfranchised women away from the activities of power.
### The historical role of capitalism 
As long as the division of labour was still basic, assigning certain tasks to men and others to women seemed like the most obvious and appropriate form of organization. But with increasing specialisation the criterion of sex became increasingly obsolete and superfluous, but did not dissapear. Capitalism was revolutionary, since its notion of commodity allowed an objective comparison of men's and women's work quantified by the price of a product on a market. This system is what allowed slogans such as “Equal pay for equal work!” to emerge. Under capitalism the idea that women and men could play the same social roles without differentiation and share the same rights and duties was made possible, because "work" blended all the tasks that were previously attached to specific gender. This abstraction triggered the process in which gender become identical in terms of their economic activity.
