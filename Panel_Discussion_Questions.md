Dear [panelist],

My names is Vipin Kumar, I am the representative officer at UiODoc and I first to thank you for accepting to join the event as a panelist. 

To advertise the event and to get to make the content of the event clearer would it be possible for you to provide us with a short description of yourself and your professional experience/action with regards the current pandemic? 

This would help the audience to better grasp the stakes of the panel discussion and ourselves in fine-tuning the questions we will cover during the event.

I have also attached to this email the flyer for this event so that you can spread the word about this event to your audience on social media and colleagues.

Thanking you in advance,
Best regards,

Vipin Kumar, UiODoc representative Officer


Dear Sir/Madam,

My names is Vipin Kumar, I am the representative officer at UiODoc,  which is an organization that works to support and improve the academic, educational and social experiences of PhD candidates and postdocs at the University of Oslo. We aim to represent their interests within UiO and provide academic/social networking opportunities across all faculties by organizing both professional and social events.

With UiODoc, we are organising a panel discussion on January 27th (12:00-13:30) about the effects of covid-19 on young researchers, targeted primarily to PhDs and postdocs at UiO. We will highlight both the effects on research, the effects on individuals, and what we can do about it collectively. To have a balanced discussion, we will have the UiO Rektor, a delegate from a young researcher organisation, a local union representative, ​and someone working towards the wellbeing of young researchers giving their complementary perspective to the discussion.

We noticed your IMPACT Breakfast event focused on COVID-19 takes place earlier on the same day with a complementary perspective on the issue. We found this coincidence could be an opportunity to coordinate the promotion of our respective events so that our target audiences can benefit from the complementary content provided by both events?

Looking forward to hearing back from you,
Best regards,
Vipin Kumar, UiODoc representative officer.

Dear [panelist],

My name is Cecilie W. Lilleheil. I have a master's degree in Human Geography (2005), I have practical pedagogical training from UiO (2007) and I am currently doing a four year training to be a Gestalt therapist (I am half way through my third year now). I have two children (twins, 9 years old) and I live at Årvoll in Oslo. 

Cecilie has worked in the field of administration for 14 years and has been a full time union representative for Forskerforbundet at UiO since August 2016.
She has been working directly with the consequences of the pandemic both in meetings with individual members and the UiO leadership. In this effort she engaged a variety of issues dealing with contractual adjustments, mental health issues or administrative transparency. These initiatives led to the actualisation of UiO guidelines for contract extension for doctoral and post-doctoral research fellows in light of the pandemic impact. She also promoted a greater grassroot engagement from UiO staff on these issues through events such as the "Know your rights"-course for PhD and Postdocs that have highlighted timely issues regarding working conditions and unexpected challenges this pandemic has brought.

Those we are in contact with are worried about whether they will reach their goals with projects within the allotted time, and they are unsure of what support they can receive from the employer. 
    - receive the dissertation on time 
    - be able to collect data 
    - perform experiments 
    - collect external funds 
    - publish articles 
    - canceled, necessary trip abroad to do fieldwork? 

Does the project need to be rewritten? 

Will the institution have the financial means to help them reach their goal, now or later? 
What about care tasks that prevent them from working? 
The pandemic has also led to new tasks, 
    such as research on the pandemic, 
    participation in the public debate and crisis management. 

In a meeting with UiO's management, we have repeated that UiO as an employer must handle this. UiO must guarantee that research fellows, postdoctoral fellows and temporary employees who have lost and are losing time due to the pandemic are given the necessary extension so that they can have an opportunity to reach the goal of their projects.

Extension for NFR fellows and postdoctoral fellows
This summer, the Research Council promised to compensate for delays for candidates who had six months left on their contract when the corona measures were implemented in March. 

At UiO, the faculties were given a deadline of 26 August to report which candidates this applied to. It was different how the faculties handled this, and whether they chose to obtain information from their affected research fellows and postdocs, or whether they themselves found out to whom this applied.

Some faculties also chose to accept applications from PhD students and postdocs that they financed themselves, while at other units there was never information on how PhDs and postdocs should deal with their delays.

We therefore chose to inform our members, and several were allowed to apply within the NFR deadline, but what about the others? The uncertainty among those who were not affected by the agreement with NFR increased. How should their delays be compensated?

Assessment shall be made on an individual basis
UiO has been clear that the assessment of an application for an extension must be made on an individual basis. The guidelines clearly state that: "Extension will be considered after an individual, concrete, factual and comprehensive assessment of whether the research fellow / postdoctoral fellow has actually been delayed in his / her research education."

Nevertheless, we constantly experience that there is a sin against this, and there are large local variations in who can apply and how the applications are processed and what is considered a "real" delay. Some have been granted a three-month extension, while others experience that their faculty quickly refuses, and then on the wrong basis.

We experience institutes that reject applications without processing, because in their opinion they should only consider an extension for those who should have finished by September this year. At other units, we experience rejection because the employer believes the candidate will be able to make up for lost time. UiO cannot be aware of this type of answer!

Discrimination can lead to the loss of good candidates
UiO and the sector risk losing good researchers with the dissatisfaction that follows from the differential treatment we now experience at UiO. For some, the uncertainty associated with extension has led them to take partial leave from their position to take up another position outside the higher education sector. Here there is a danger that they will never finish. Others have lost important lab time and important basis for further research.

Everyone who is delayed according to current guidelines at UiO should be given compensation in the form of an extension after an individual assessment of their application. The units must follow up and ensure a good and fair treatment of applicants. It is absolutely crucial that UiO takes young researchers seriously, and does everything they can to ensure that they reach their goals.
